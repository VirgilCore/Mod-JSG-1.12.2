1. You are ***allowed*** to:
	*  Look around the code and figure out what we did (feel free to ask about certain solutions, on [*Discord*](https://discord.gg/NXp4NA8mBR) for example).
	*  Clone the repo and build it for your private use (or sharing with a limited number of people. ***No reuploads.***).
	*  Clone and make pull requests.


2. You're ***not allowed*** to:
	* Copy-paste the code into your own project. One function or helper class is good, copying whole functionality (Like RaumShips owner did, copied whole Old rings) is not.
